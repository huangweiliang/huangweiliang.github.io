# The advantages of a large orginization

A large organization is like a substantial vessel. Such a vessel remains stable when encountering significant waves. A large organization offers its employees a vast array of opportunities and resources, enabling them to continually enhance their skills and knowledge.

Moreover, a large organization consistently captures and adapts to market trends and technological advancements. This proactive approach ensures that the organization remains competitive and innovative.

Additionally, a large organization possesses extensive global resources and can manage these resources effectively. This global reach and resource management ability allow the organization to operate efficiently across different regions and markets.

The advantages might also change to be the problems that cause additional costs when facing some competitors.

For example, the cooperation of engineers from different locations, communication, and development dependency will cause additional time and cost in release delivery Compared to competitors with all developers at the same location.

It is not about which way is good or bad. It is about how some advantages can become disadvantages when faced with competitors nowadays.

# Some suggestions for large orginization to speedup

I will list some points from working level which the direct feeling of the slow from the daily work in the large orginization.

## The communication
Communication is so important that there is communication skills training to improve the employees' software skills. Even if we speak the same language, we still have communication issues during our daily work. That is because different people have different backgrounds. There is a knowledge gap or information gap between people. So we should be aware that we give enough context and background information before we discuss something with someone else. 
For example, when display and LCM engineers discuss an issue related to system power management. 
Another example is issue description. How can an issue be described accurately so that others can fully understand what exactly happened? The writer needs to make the description like a film to present a view to the reader. The writer should also consider whether he can get enough information from the text by reading it.
E-mail discussions shall be stopped in case the issue is still unclear after 3 e-mail communications. A conference call is necessary to clarify the unclear parts of the topics or issues. 

## "NO RESOURCE" shall not be a reason

We can not deliver this feature in 2 weeks because we don't currently have the resources. We don't have an ETA for this feature release.

What a simple reason !! But it shall not be accepted !!

## Do some changes for the planning

The scrum process is a good agile method for the team to define a goal and break down the steps to reach the goal. Then, make the development plan for each step. This process actually pushes the team members to think about what they need to prepare for every step before they start the work, to identify the gaps and dependencies before they start the work.

To ensure the team can 100% finish the work, the planning normally only plans 50% 60 of the team's capacity. 
A better way is to plan the work, which is %120 of the team's capacity, with %20 being the tasks we can accept for the team not being able to finish them. The team shall try their best to achieve the %120 goal. Those %20 are the highlights of the team's performance in case they can finish them.

So, if we define %120, we can get %100 ~ %120. If we only define %60 work, we can only get %60 output.

## Efforts estimation reasonable or not

When a team plans features, team members estimate how long they need to spend on each step. Different engineers have different capabilities, so they take different amounts of time to finish the same task. But what are reasonable efforts to be selected finally? 
First, all the team members need to correctly understand what needs to be implemented. Second, every team must have a technical expert to ensure reasonable efforts are selected. Learning time is also cost. If a team member is very clear about how to implement the task. For faster delivery. We shall select this engineer to take the task. However, we can only let this experienced engineer take on some of the tasks. So, less experienced engineers can start work earlier and learn from experienced engineers.
It is fair that the engineers spend additional time studying but not let the project pay the learning cost.
Engineers learn something new: personal capability improvement. This capability shall be available for the project.
