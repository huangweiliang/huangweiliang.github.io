# Talk about my experience for windows

I still remember when our company switched from Windows XP to Windows 7. Windows 7 is the best OS from Microsoft so far after Windows XP.
Windows 10, oh the nightmare from the beginning after upgrading. There are always file corruptions, and the office software can not start even after the IT department reinstalls it. No one can explain why. It was stable after around one year and worked smoothly for my daily work. Although I am a Linuxer, for daily work, I have to use Windows. I have a separate Linux Machine for software development.

Continue for Win10. After around two or three years, the system needs to be upgraded to Windows 11. Currently, it is in a junk state, in my point of view. There is a second level of right-click. You know, I hate such a way to force users to adapt themselves to this operation behavior. It means Microsoft is forcing users. I started hating this OS, especially when I need 10s to open a file explorer at home even when the laptop is fresh started.

# The annoying language bar
