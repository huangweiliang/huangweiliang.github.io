# fio:Flexible I/O tester

fio is an I/O tool intended to be used both for benchmark and stress/hardware verification.

Orginally it is supporting cross compiling for following OSs:

* Linux
* Android
* AIX|OpenBSD|NetBSD
* FreeBSD
* SunOS
* CYGWIN

Here is patch from my [branch](https://github.com/axboe/fio/compare/master...huangweiliang:fio_for_qnx:3.37_for_qnx) to support the QNX OS.
