# About Light
From the moment he said, 'Let there be light,' he created this world. \
In modern society, with advanced technology, humans can easily obtain light, which seems ordinary and commonplace. \
You can light a piece of paper or turn on a light bulb to get light. \
It gives us the feeling that what he created is easily accessible to us. 

However, the reality is not so simple. The source of all energy on our planet is in the form of light, and that is the sun. \
Without the sun, life on Earth would not be possible. There would be no seasons, no suitable temperature, and no diverse organisms. \
The sun is the source of all energy. \
Behind the simple sentence in the book, there may be the fact that he placed a sun there.
